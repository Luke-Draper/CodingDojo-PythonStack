pip install Django==1.11.9
This command installs the 1.11.9 release of Django

pip list
This command lists the currently installed packages and their versions

deactivate
This command closes the virtual environment

pip3 list
In my installation this is an aliased command. as such pip list and pip3 list return the same result. This is not always the case, especially in older python installations.

source py3Env/Scripts/activate
This command starts the virtual environment

pip install Django==1.11.9
This command installs the 1.11.9 release of Django. Because this is already installed on my system the command does nothing.

pip freeze
As I understand it this outputs the currently required packages to run the current process. List simply lists installed packages.

cd into your Desktop directory then run pip freeze > requirements.txt
This outputs a file called requirements.txt with the output from pip freeze inside.

pip uninstall Django
This command uninstalls Django

pip show Django
This returns nothing as Django is uninstalled

pip search Flask
this returns a list of all packages that have Flask or flask in the title.
